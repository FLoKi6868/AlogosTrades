# AlogosTrades

AlogosTrades is a Python-based application designed to analyze and rank stocks and options using custom metrics, advanced analytics, and machine learning. Initially focused on options trading, this project is structured to allow for future expansion into other asset classes, such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, and futures.

## Features

### Current Functionality
- **Custom Stock Ranking:**
  - Uses a composite formula combining Market Cap and Volume to rank top S&P 500 companies.
  - Adjustable weighting factors (alpha and beta) for fine-tuning rankings.
- **Options Analysis:**
  - Fetches and filters options chains for selected stocks based on strike prices, open interest, and implied volatility.
  - Highlights actionable options with high potential.

### Future Plans
- **Expand Asset Classes:**
  - Add support for stocks, cryptocurrencies, and futures.
- **Machine Learning Integration:**
  - Predictive models for stock price trends, options movements, and volatility forecasting.
- **Dynamic Watchlist:**
  - Automatically track stocks showing growth in key metrics, such as trading volume.
- **Web Interface:**
  - Build a user-friendly web app using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `yfinance`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `flask` or `streamlit` (for web interface)
  - `beautifulsoup4` (if scraping S&P 500 tickers from Wikipedia)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AlogosTrades.git
   cd AlogosTrades
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

### Stock Ranking
1. Fetches the list of top S&P 500 companies dynamically.
2. Uses a composite score formula:
   ```
   Composite Score = (alpha * Market Cap / Max Market Cap) + (beta * Volume / Max Volume)
   ```
3. Ranks companies based on the calculated score.

### Options Analysis
1. Retrieves options data for the top-ranked stocks.
2. Filters options based on:
   - Strike price distance from the current stock price.
   - Open interest (liquidity).
   - Implied volatility (if applicable).

### Outputs
- Results are displayed in a clear tabular format.
- Future versions will include visualizations and predictive analytics.

## Contribution
Although this project is currently for personal use, it is structured to be open-source and ready for collaboration. Future updates will include detailed contribution guidelines and documentation for developers. Additionally, if after sufficient testing the program demonstrates a consistently profitable and successful rate, it will be considered for public deployment to allow others to use it.
